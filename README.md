# Binomial Distribution - Heuristic Approach vs Mathematical
Simple implementation of Binomial distribution

You may play around with the values within BinomialDistribution.java
- iterations = 100_000;
- maxPossiblePositives = 50;
- checkBinomialDistributionValue = 43;
- successRate = 0.95;

The program returns a heuristic random value approach and for comparison an accurate mathematical implementation

## Run the program
You need to have Java SDK installed and [Path variables](https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10) set accordingly

I used [OpenJDK 11 with  OpenJ9 JVM](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9) for this example

If everything is in place simply run the attached execut.bat file.
